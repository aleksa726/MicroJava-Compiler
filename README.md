# MicroJava-Compiler
Fully functional compiler for a custom Java-like programming language called MicroJava.

Program compiler with:
* Lexical analysis
* Syntax analysis
* Semantic analysis
* Bytecode generator

MicroJava is a high-level programming language, similar, but simpler than Java. Similarly to Java, MicroJava source files are compiled to bytecode, which is then executed by a virtual machine (MicroJava Virtual Machine). MicroJava VM is a simple interpretative emulator.
